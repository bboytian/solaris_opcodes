Objectives

1. select product data

2. convert data 3d array

3. visualise


Scope of use

=> Data input is cloud position => arabuilder

   - pairing with angular position, we can locate the cloud bottom.

   - For a given pixel we have a list of cloud positions

   - thus a 3d array: 0-axis -> row, 1-axis -> columns, 2-axis ->
     cloud values

=> Data input is range with corresponding values => linebuilder

   - 3d line plot

=> For future, discretisation of single pixel column with spacing
dependent on SHDOM, the input array would then become a mask


Technical details

- height and bearing offset of lidar to be keyed in here
